The experimental track uses an \"endorsement\" model, where review proceeds as a back-and-forth between reviewers and authors via Github issues, and then reviewers can choose whether or not to endorse the paper. \n\nThe articles below are still under review and have not yet received any endorsements. Feedback on these articles is welcome in the form of Github issues opened on their underlying repository.\n\n\n- [Gatherplot: A Non-Overlapping Scatterplot](https://www.journalovi.org/2023-park-gatherplots)<br>\\[[Repository](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots) | [Reviews/Issues](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues)\\]\n\n\n### VISxAI 2023 \n\nThe articles below were originally part of [VISxAI 2023](https://visxai.io/) and are now under review for a special issue at JoVI:\n\n\n- [PAC Learning; Or: Why We Should \\(and Shouldn't\\) Trust Machine Learning](https://www.journalovi.org/2024-Cashman-PAC-learning-game)<br>\\[[Repository](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Cashman-PAC-learning-game) | [Reviews/Issues](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Cashman-PAC-learning-game/issues)\\]\n - [Neighborhood traces](https://www.journalovi.org/2024-Dueck-neighborhood-traces)<br>\\[[Repository](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Dueck-neighborhood-traces) | [Reviews/Issues](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Dueck-neighborhood-traces/issues)\\]\n - [Learning Whatâ€™s in a Name with Graphical Models](https://www.journalovi.org/2024-luong-graphical-models)<br>\\[[Repository](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-luong-graphical-models) | [Reviews/Issues](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-luong-graphical-models/issues)\\]\n",
